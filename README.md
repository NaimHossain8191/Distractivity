# Distractivity

> **Turn your distraction into productivity**

Distractivity tracks your browser to check social media activity. If any social media is active (currently Facebook & Youtube ), it'll be marked <span style="color:red">RED</span> in the calendar, else it'll be marked <span style="color:green">GREEN</span> in the calendar.
It uses a simple streaking system to encourage you (especially **ME**) motivated, cause I get super distracted after roughly 30 minutesðŸ˜….

I'm hoping that it'll keep you as well as me motivated to get <span style="color:green">GREEN</span> mark everyday.


## Upcoming Features

- It'll be gamified soon
- You'll be able to move it to the tray so that it runs in the background and don't bother you

Let me know if you have any idea to improve it.
